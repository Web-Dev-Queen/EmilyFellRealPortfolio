				<p>I was a teacher, but that wasn't my cup of tea. <br> My three children helped me realize that I and <br> the three of them are too precious to take for granted. <br> I want to make an ordered splash aka ripple effect <br> on this world: starting at devCodeCamp <br> is my first step in this pivotal adventure we call life.</p>
